# Product Madness UGUI Art Test

This repository contains my implementation of the **Product Madness UGUI Art Test**.  
The task was to demonstrate skills in Unity UI (UGUI), responsive layouts, optimization, and animation.

## Part One â€” Level Up Popup

### Features:
- **Responsive UI**  
  - Canvas set to *Scale with Screen Size* (base resolution: iPad).  
  - Popup scales and repositions correctly across multiple aspect ratios (16:9, 4:3, 19.5:9).  

- **Dynamic buttons layout**  
  - Supports 1, 2, 3, or more buttons.  
  - No duplicated prefabs â€” buttons reposition automatically inside a flexible RectTransform layout.  

- **Optimization**  
  - Assets prepared into atlases to keep draw calls around **5 or less**.  

- **Animation**  
  - "Appear" animation (~5 seconds).  
  - Includes scaling, fade-in, and celebratory effects (particles + motion).  
  - Starts from an empty screen â†’ ends with the final popup layout.

## Part Two â€” Character Integration

### Features:
- Character imported into Unity.  
- Idle animation created (breathing, subtle movements, blinking).  
- Rigged for reuse and future animation cycles.  
- Gives the character a sense of personality and life.
